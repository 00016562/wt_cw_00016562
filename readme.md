I decided to chose "OqTepa Lavash" fast foof company's website and recreate it in my own way. Icannot say that my version of website is better, due to lack of experince in front-end development, but still i have written some elements that original version did not have. Here is the process of my course work:
The process begins with a careful planning stage where the main goals are to specify the target market, define the goal of the website, and list the salient characteristics. The goal of my project, the "Oq Tepa Lavash" website, is to highlight our fast-food selection, branch locations, social media activity, and other features.
The planning stage is followed by the design phase, which is carefully laid out. In order to do this, wireframes and mockups that express the website's layout and design components graphically must be created. To stay true to the company identity, I've chosen a red, yellow, and white color scheme for consistency in this setting. To improve the overall visual appeal, elements like dynamic pictures and animated headlines are skillfully used.
Once the design has been approved, the development stage assumes prominence. Here, HTML is used for content structure, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript is used for interactive elements to convert the design into a fully functional website. Interestingly, the navigation bar is designed with flex qualities to guarantee smooth device adaptability. The navigation and branch pages use CSS Grid, which provides a logical and aesthetically beautiful layout.
JavaScript is used for form validation, which verifies that user input meets predetermined standards before to submission. The whole experience is improved by this user-centric approach, which avoids processing of inaccurate or incomplete data.
Making sure the website is responsive—that is, that it works properly on different devices—is a major focus point for the duration of this phase. In order to adjust layout and styling depending on various screen sizes, this calls for the thoughtful application of media queries and flexible design techniques.
